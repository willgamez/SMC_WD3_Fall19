                                    <p>HOLY QUOKKA! aren't these things amazing? The quokka is a mammal about the size of a cat, native to Australia. The quokka is a marsupial of the macropod family, and is similar in appearance to a small type of Wallaby. Quokkas are herbivores and they tend to be most active at night (nocturnal). Quokkas are believed to be one of the first mammals in Australia to be seen by Europeans, who described them as looking like wild cats. They were later mistaken for large rats. Rottnest "Rotte nest" Island was given its name because of this mistake, as this translates to 'rat's nest'. The quokka is considered to be a vulnerable species today.

                                            <p>If a quokka mother is threatened by a predator she will often throw her baby on the ground to distract the predator and save her own life.
                                                    Quokkas are not afraid of people but it is illegal for people to turn them into pets.
                                                    Quokkas are smart and will do anything for food, even learning tricks to get tourists to feed them.
                                                    Although tourists like quokkas many locals that must live with them do not. Quokkas are bold and will enter buildings such as homes and restaurants.
