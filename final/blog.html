        <p class="lead">Gavin 12-2-19 <br>
          <br>Those that are asking have probably tasted how the grind size influences the quality of their hot brewed coffee. Too fine, and it's an over-extracted, bitter cup. Too coarse, and the result is an under-developed, watery substance. While the slow-drip cold brewing method has some fundamental differences from hot brewing techniques, grind size will still play a role in the quality of the cold brew. In this post, we'll take a look at three different grind sizes and the resulting influence on extraction and taste.</p>
      <br> <p>It's difficult to describe grind sizes. What exactly is coarse? Or fine? Grind size is relative, so the easiest way is to compare them visually. Above, the three grind sizes we tested are shown with table salt and a penny for reference. The espresso grind is really fine. It's finer than the table salt (though it looks similar), and almost feels like flour. The drip grind is much coarser than both the table salt and espresso grind. It's got a definite gritty feel between the fingers. Reminds me of the beach sand in Santa Cruz. This is also the grind we do most of our cold brews with. The coarsest of the three is something we use for our french press. It's definitely got some big chunks.

      You'll notice that each grind does not consist of all the same sized particles. What we've got is a range of particle sizes with the "average" being our desired grind size. All coffee grinders (including the burr grinders we use) will produce a distribution of particle sizes. The only way to get a uniform grind size is to use a sieve to sort out the desired size. But it's not really necessary. As long as our grinder is producing a narrow particle size distribution  (the vast majority of particles are close in size), having varying sized particles is no a significant problem. The most important thing is that we're getting consistency from grind to grind.  Coffee grinding is a fascinating subject. Expect a future post on grinders where we'll dive more in depth.

        <p class="lead">Jamie 11/15/19 <br><br>

          "Quick. Drink this one." I did. It was hot, syrupy, and deeply bittersweet.
          
          "Now watch this one." We did. An amber foam slowly formed a thick layer on top of the drink. Then, we watched as the foam dissolved back into the espresso, leaving a lacy residue on the sides of the glass. The process took about a minute.
          
          "Now drink this one." This time, the espresso was significantly cooler, yet still syrupy. But the flavor had definitely changed. The espresso tasted burned, almost ashy, and hardly palatable. I might have gagged.
          
          "This," my boss instructed, "this is a dead espresso."
          
          In your coffee journey, you may have heard something similar. The idea that if left to sit, an espresso will transform from the most lovely of beverages into something totally undrinkable. But what makes an espresso "die"? And do you really have to gulp down piping hot coffee in order to get the full experience?
          
          Foam Is Where The Heart Is
          
          It's hard to say exactly where the idea of "dead espresso" originates. It is most likely an offshoot of Italian espresso tradition. For the Neapolitan drinker, crema, the layer of foam on top of the liquid espresso, is an essential part of a great coffee. In fact, some Italian espresso enthusiasts swear that truly fine espresso should have a crema so dense that it can support a whole teaspoon of sugar for a minimum of a few seconds.
          
          Unfortunately, time is the enemy of dense crema. The tight network of bubbles will break down as water evaporates and the emulsified lipids in the beverage interact with the foam.
          
          But there is more to espresso than foam. What about flavor?</p>

        <p class="lead">Alexis- 10-12-19 <br> <br>Siphon coffee is traditionally a brewing method done mostly by hand, requiring precise temperature, attention, and skill. The results are well worth the effort—with some experts proclaiming it’s the best you can brew—but it hasn’t been a practical way for the average busy household to make coffee until now.

            KitchenAid recently released a siphon coffee maker that removes a lot of the guesswork out of the process, making it a realistic—somewhat theatrical—option for home use.
            
            An underground movement among coffee drinkers has brought siphon brewing back into the spotlight. In fact, a San Francisco cafe recently made news for purchasing a $20,000 siphon coffee maker and serving only coffee brewed this way.
            
            I’ve been intrigued by it for years, having written about an antique siphon coffee maker at Four Seasons Hotel Florence a few years ago, but haven’t tried to make it until now.
            
            If you cherish a cup of perfection in the morning, this brewing method might be for you.</p>
